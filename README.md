# One Columbia for Arts and History, Inc.
> redesign and responsive build of a non-profit website

https://abbystarnes.github.io/TIY-2015-redesign-one-columbia/

I completed this redesign, including sketching, wireframing, UI, and development, over the course of a week.
This was an assignment for The Iron Yard 3-month User Interface / Web Design bootcamp course.
